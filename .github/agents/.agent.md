You are tasked with migrating an existing Application Insights (App Insights) setup to OpenTelemetry (OTEL). Your goal is to create a comprehensive migration plan that outlines the necessary steps to transition from App Insights to OTEL, ensuring minimal disruption to existing monitoring and telemetry. The human must review this plan and confirm before you proceed to implement the steps below.

Azure Monitor will be the OTLP backend. Take the OTLP backend URL from the connectionstring that's currently being passed in for App Insights SDK. The instrumentation will be done using the OpenTelemetry .NET SDK, and the migration will involve replacing the existing App Insights SDK with the OpenTelemetry SDK in the application code.

[] Review my current code.

[] Create a plan for changing App Insights SDK to OTEL.

[] Pause here until a human confirms the plan before proceeding with implementation steps.

[] Implement the migration plan.


<!-- Provide a diagram of the current configuration, and then a diagram detailing what the new solution will look like with OTEL. After that, create a step-by-step migration plan that includes the following:
1. Assessment of the current App Insights setup, including all configurations, custom metrics, and dependencies.
2. Identification of the OTEL components that will replace the existing App Insights features.
3. A detailed migration strategy that includes timelines, resource allocation, and risk mitigation strategies.
4. Ensure old Application insights data is not lost during the migration. Provide a strategy for data retention and access to historical telemetry data after the migration to OTEL.
5. Provide a rollback plan in case any issues arise during the migration process, ensuring that the system can quickly revert to the previous App Insights setup if necessary.
6. Pause here and ask me to confirm before proceeding to change any code. I want to see what changes you'd make, as well as review the rollback plan before you start changing code. Once I confirm, you can proceed with the implementation steps.
7. Also clean up any Application Insights configuration from your appsettings.json. comment out the ApplicationInsights section and the instrumentation key entries, don't delete them. This will be used to revert back to if rollback plan is needed.
8. Replace AddApplicationInsights() with AddOpenTelemetry() in the program.cs file. Make sure to configure the OpenTelemetry SDK to send telemetry data to Azure Monitor using the OTLP exporter.
9. Replace TelemetryClient.TrackEvent(), TrackMetric(), and TrackTrace() calls in the application code with the corresponding OpenTelemetry API calls to ensure that all telemetry data is correctly captured and sent to Azure Monitor.
10. Consider these common pitfalls:
  - Forgetting to register ActivitySource for OpenTelemetry, which is necessary for capturing custom telemetry data.
  - Not filtering health check endpoints, which can lead to noise in telemetry data and increased costs.
  - Missing SQL query capture, which can result in loss of valuable telemetry data for database operations.
  - Environment variable conflicts, which can cause issues with configuration and deployment. If you set APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING as an environment variable, make sure to remove it.
10. A testing and validation plan to ensure that the new OTEL setup is functioning correctly and providing the necessary telemetry data. Do this with a test metric, a test event and a test trace. Ask the user to provide a test metric, a test event and a test trace that you can use to validate the new OTEL setup. Confirm input has been provided before continuing.
11. Make these changes in a separate branch and create a pull request for review and merging into the main branch.
12. Comment out the existing App Insights SDK code and don't delete it. This will be used to revert back to if rollback plan is needed.

Finally, provide a checklist of tasks to be completed during the migration process, and assign responsibilities for each task to ensure accountability and smooth execution. -->
